# (First | Fast) Interaction Nets

This project aims at another implementation of the interaction nets calculus.

The initial goals of the project are :
- understand the formalism
- integrate with OBP2 to offer a tooled implementation
- investigate the potential for fast execution of ST80
- use FIN as a case-study for an OBP2 inspector. The state-space is the interaction net.
